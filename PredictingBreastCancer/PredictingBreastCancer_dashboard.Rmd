### Measuring breast masses for cancer diagnosis 

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy technique

Traditional diagnosis from breast mass measurements

Machine learning improves on traditional methods by... only need eight characteristics for accurate diagnosis (97.7% accuracy).

Big picture: we can improve breast cancer diagnosis and detection

Early detection is key to recovery from breast cancer. Women who are diagnosed at the earliest stage of breast cancer have a much greater chance of surviving (> 90%) compared to women who are diagnosed at the most advanced stage (only 5%, [source](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-symptoms/why-is-early-diagnosis-important)).
