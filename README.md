# Machine Learning Portfolio

Here, I present a diverse set of data science projects which showcases data mining and preparation, data exploration, data visualization, modeling, and interpretation of the results. 

### Each project includes: 
* README file that outlines the objective/question for the particular data science problem along with background information and results
* R script/markdown that includes all of the data processing and modeling along with comments that help to show my thought process (*e.g.*, why I chose certain models, choice of data transformation, etc.)
* R dashboard to visualize and interpret the results
